# Spotion ðŸŽµ

Spotion generates a 50-song Spotify playlist from the emotion in a picture. It uses the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to detect the emotion in a picture, and then uses the Spotify API to generate a playlist based on the emotion.

Note: I am currently out of Azure credits, so Spotion is currently down. Feel free to clone this repo and add your own API keys to use Spotion! All Azure functions used are in the `/azure_functions` folder.

1. Take a picture of yourself with your webcam.
2. Login with spotify.
3. Get a emotion-based playlist added to your account!
